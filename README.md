# prefix.cc-harvester

Some code to retrieve the ontologies for which a prefix has been registered on [prefix.cc](http://prefix.cc). 

Build and run with [maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

Note, that while this project would not be possible without the awesome [prefix.cc](http://prefix.cc/) service it is in no way associated with it.
